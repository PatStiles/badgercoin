# BadgerCoin

Ultra-basic blockchain project with TypeScript. [Thanks Jeff!](https://youtu.be/qF7dkrce-mQ)

## Getting Started

"What's your favorite feature of BadgerCoin? What's gonna make this puppy moon?"

BadgerCoin is a fully-centralized cryptocurrency that utilizes the insecure MD5 hash function to verify transactions. These unique characteristics enable the BadgerCoin network (also known as your computer) to process transactions with no additional fees. In other words, it is the future of digital cash.

## Usage

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
